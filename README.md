# dat250-FeedApp

1. Import this project as a maven-project such that the database dependencies are loaded.
2. Run Main.java You will se a new directory called home/sigve/Skole/dat250/group_2_dat250 (should be renamed)
3. In Intelij open database --> New Database --> Apache derby --> home/sigve/Skole/dat250/group_2_dat250 user = test password = test
4. At this point you will get an error if you run main again as email must be unique, you can either rename mail or remove /home/sigve/Skole/dat250/group_2_dat250 
5. Remember if the database is running you will get ERROR code 40000, turn it of and everything will be fine.

TODO check if join table is nessecary in every case. Unidirectional or bidirectional relations?
